frogga teh travla

this is a little atmega program to obtain data from various
navigation sensors and produce meaningful display useful
for navigating on a hike or a bike.

this is a development prototype. main idea is to understand
what is important for each component and how to construct
the next version that is to be more practical on the road.

fun parts include blinking lights and an mp3 player.
